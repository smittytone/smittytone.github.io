    <h3>Squinter 2.3.130 (14 August 2019)</h3>
    <p><b>Important</b><br />Squinter 2.3 requires macOS 10.12 or above (versions 2.0. and 2.1 required macOS 10.11 or above).</p>
    <p><b>Improvements</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can now select <b>Log All Devices</b> from the <b>Device Groups</b> menu to start logging from
            all of the devices assigned to that group, if there are any and they're not logging already.</li>
        <li>The <b>Device</b> has a new option, <b>Close All Log Streams</b>, which halts logging from all devices whose logs
            are currently being streamed.</li>
        <li>The Inspector panel now presents folder icons alongside code filenames &mdash; click on it
            to reveal the file in Finder.</li>
        <li>Squinter now has offline help, missing since version 2.0.0. Hold down <kbd>Opt</kbd> and click on the <b>Help</b> menu
            to access the offline help view.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Bug Fixes</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Correctly show and hide the <b>Previous Device Group</b> and <b>Next Device Group</b> <b>Device Groups</b> menu
            items when there are more than one device groups in the current project.</li>
    </ul>
