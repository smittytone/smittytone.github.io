                        <h2>About Squinter</h2>
                        <p>Squinter is a utility to help you work on Electric Imp software development projects using your own editor and code
                        files you keep in a local folder &mdash; which may also be sync’d with a cloud service like Dropbox or a version control
                        system like GitHub.</p>
                        <p align="center"><img src="../../images/gfx/squinter.png" width="600" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
                        <p>With Squinter and the impCentral API you can:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Work on your Electric Imp project code in your favourite text editor</li>
                            <li>‘Compile’ in local library files before uploading the complete code to the Electric Imp impCloud&trade;</li>
                            <li>You can take charge of your devices:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Assign them to application firmware (via device groups)</li>
                                <li>Update their code</li>
                                <li>Reboot devices to run newly uploaded code</li>
                                <li>View device logs</li>
                            </ul></li>
                            <li>And much more...</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Important</h3>
                        <p>Squinter 2.0 is being made available in a pre-release ‘Beta’ version which is not feeature-complete and may
                        contain code errors that may impact your own code. You should not use Squinter with commercially sensitive
                        code.<br>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Working With Projects and Products</h2>
                        <p>Squinter works with Projects, each of which is stored as a project file on disk. Projects record which agent
                        and device code files comprise a given model, and which external libraries and files, and Electric Imp libraries
                        they use. Project files are identified by the <code>.squirrelproj</code> file extension. Squinter lets you
                        create new projects, either from scratch or from existing Products in the Electric Imp impCloud.</p>
                        <p align="center"><img src="../../images/gfx/new.png" width="612" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
                        <p>Projects are listed in the ‘Open Projects’ submenu in the ‘Projects’ menu, which also presents actions you can
                        perform with the currently selected project. You can also select a project from the ‘Current Project’ popup in
                        Squinter’s main window.</p>
                        <p>New projects are saved initially to Squinter’s working directory, which you can set in the Preferences. To create
                        a new Project, click on appropriate toolbar button or select the relevant option from the ‘Files’ menu. This menu also
                        lists recently opened projects &mdash; as does Squinter’s dock icon. You can also save your current Project to a new
                        file if you wish.</p>
                        <p align="center"><img src="../../images/gfx/projects.png" width="526" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
                        <p>The ‘Projects’ menu also presents a list of Products associated with your Electric Imp account in the impCloud.
                        Each Project maintains a one-to-one mapping with a uniquely named Product. New Projects are uploaded to the
                        impCloud as Products, and existing Products can be downloaded as Projects, complete with any Device Groups
                        they contain.</p>
                        <p align="center"><img src="../../images/gfx/products.png" width="554" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
                        <p>Squinter also allows you to perform tasks on a selected Product, including linking it to an existing project,
                        or deleting it from the impCloud. Only Products that contain Device Groups with no assigned devices (or no Device
                        Groups at all) can be deleted.<br>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Working With Device Groups</h2>
                        <p>Squinter lists all of the Device Groups that belong to a given Project. When you select a Project,
                        its Device Groups, if any, are listed in the ‘Project’s Device Groups’ submenu in the ‘Device Groups’
                        menu. Initially the first Device Group, listed alphabetically, is selected when you select a Project.
                        Only the Device Groups that belong to the currently selected Project are listed, so to view a Device
                        Group from another Project, just select or open that project.</p>
                        <p align="center"><img src="../../images/gfx/models.png" width="632" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
                        <p>If any devices have been assigned to a Device Group, they are listed as submenus off each Device Group
                        listed in the ‘Project’s Device Groups’ submenu. Selecting a device causes its parent Device Group to be
                        selected too.</p>
                        <p>When you select a Project or one of its Device Groups, the ‘Device Groups’ menu provides a number
                        on the selected Device Group. This includes editing its name and/or description, getting information
                        about the code deployed to it, and event deleting the Device Group from your Project and the impCloud.
                        However, you can’t delete a Device Group that has devices assigned to it. You can restart simultaneously
                        all of the devices assigned to the selected Device Group here too.</p>
                        <p>Because the code you work on will be uploaded to a given Device Group rather than to a Project
                        (as was the case with Squinter 1.0), you will find the commands that allow you to access a Device Group’s
                        source code files (and any libraries or other Squirrel files they contain) from submenus included
                        in the ‘Device Groups’ menu.</p>
                        <p align="center"><img src="../../images/gfx/assign.png" width="612" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
                        <p>You can add a new Device Group to a Project either by selecting the option from the ‘Project’s Device Groups’
                        submenu, or by choosing ‘Add source files to Project’ from the ‘Files’ menu. This can be used to add agent and/or
                        device code files to an existing Device Group, or to add them to a new Device Group created specially.<br>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Working With Devices</h2>
                        <p>Squinter keeps track of your development devices. It lists these in the ‘Device Groups’ menu’s ‘Project’s
                        Device Groups’ submenu, alongside the Device Group each device is assigned to. Unassigned devices are listed
                        in their own section. Specific devices can also be selected from the ‘Current Device’ popup menu in Squinter’s
                        main window.</p>
                        <p align="center"><img src="../../images/gfx/devices.png" width="600" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
                        <p>In each of these lists, devices’ status &mdash; online or offline, or logging &mdash; is listed by their names.</p>
                        <p>The ‘Device’ menu presents actions you can perform on the currently selected device, including getting information
                        about it, renaming it, removing it from your account and removing its association with a Device Group (unassign it).</p>
                        <p>You can also force the device to restart. If you want to force all the devices assigned to a given Device Group to
                        restart, not just the selected one, there’s an option for that in the ‘Device Groups’ menu.</p>
                        <p>To update the information Squinter holds about all of of your development devices, select the ‘Update Devices’ Status’
                        command in the ‘Devices’ menu. This can be selected at any time, and there is an option in Squinter’s Preferences to have
                        this information retrieved automatically whenever the app starts up.</p>
                        <p align="center"><img src="../../images/gfx/dlist.png" width="402" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
                        <p>The ‘Devices’ menu also maintains a submenu of unassigned devices &mdash; those which have not yet been assigned to a
                        Device Group or have been removed from one. Selecting a device from this list will affect the ‘Devices’ menu but not the
                        currently selected Device Group.<br>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Incorporating Libraries Into Your Code</h2>
                        <p>Squinter lets you incorporate multiple files into the source code that is deployed to a given Device Group.
                        Electric Imp applications comprise two files: one for device code, the other for cloud-based agent code,
                        but Squinter lets you embed into them links to other files, such as local libraries.</p>
                        <p>For example, you might want to use the same library in multiple Device Groups &mdash; they all use the same sensor,
                        say &mdash; even between Device Groups that belong to different Projects. Sharing a single library file allows you to
                        update that file without having to edit every listing of device or agent code that uses it. You just recompile
                        each Device Group’s source code to incorporate the changes you’ve made.</p>
                        <p align="center"><img src="../../images/gfx/libs.png" width="620" height="392" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
                        <p>Squinter expects your primary source code files &mdash; a Device Group’s base device and agent code &mdash; to be
                        named in the standard Electric Imp schema: <code>*.agent.nut</code> and <code>*.device.nut</code> for, respectively,
                        your agent and device code. The two identifiers (represented here by the wildcard *) need not be identical.</p>
                        <p>Local library files should be entered into your agent and device source code using the following syntax:<p>
                        <pre><code>#import "library_filepath\library_filename"
#include "library_filepath\library_filename"</code></pre>
                        <p>This is to distinguish these libraries from Electric Imp online libraries, which use the <code>#require</code> directive.</p>
                        <p>The name of the library file is arbitrary, but <code>*.class.nut</code> and <code>*.library.nut</code> are the
                        recommended forms. You may include a full Unix filepath; if you only provide a filename, Squinter expects the file to
                        reside in the same directory as the <code>*.squirrelproj</code> project file <i>(see ‘Working with Projects and
                        Products’)</i>. You can specify files that need to be reached by moving up through
                        your folder hierarchy by including <code>..</code> to mean ‘go up one level’. For example:</p>
                        <pre><code>#import "..../../generic/bootmessage.nut"</code></pre>
                        <p>This means go up three folders then back down to the folder <i>generic</i> and thus to the file
                        <i>bootmessage.nut</i>.</p>
                        <p align="center"><img src="../../images/gfx/files.png" width="625" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
                        <p>Internally, Squinter stores all file locations as paths relative to the project file, though you can choose how file
                        paths are listed by changing the app’s Preferences. When Squinter compiles code, it re-checks the links it has against
                        those included in the <code>#include</code> statement, updating its internal record as required. Squinter will warn you
                        if you move a file while is running.</p>
                        <p>Squinter lets you store both library files and blocks of Squirrel or other data in <code>*.nut</code> and
                        <code>*.txt</code> files. At compilation, all of these sources are inserted into a master copy of the source code, and
                        it is this ‘compiled’ Squirrel which will be uploaded to the selected Device Group.<br>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Debugging Code</h2>
                        <p>You can retrieve the most recent log entries for the selected device in one go (up to a maximum of 200),
                        or you can stream logs from the device: entries will appear in Squinter’s main window in real time. You can currently
                        only stream from up to five devices at a time.</p>
                        <p align="center"><img src="../../images/gfx/log.png" width="800" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
                        <p>When you upload code &mdash; using the ‘Upload’ button or the ‘Device Groups’ menu option &mdash; the Electric Imp
                        impCloud will perform a syntax check. Any errors it spots will be reported in Squinter’s log window. Line numbers refer
                        to the compiled code, so you can use two actions in the ‘View’ menu to list the current compiled code to help you
                        track down the errors. These two options &mdash; one for device code, the other for agent code &mdash; will list the
                        compiled source for the currently selected Device Group.</p>
                        <p>If the log window becomes too crowded, you can clear it using the ‘Clear’ button in the toolbar, which is also home to a
                        number of shortcuts to various functions provided by Squinter’s menus. You can also print the current contents of the log
                        window if you have a printer.<br>&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Configuring Squinter</h2>
                        <p>To take full advantage of Squinter’s features, you will need an Electric Imp account. With Squinter 2.0 you no
                        longer require a Build API key. Instead you must sign into your account before Squinter can access the Electric
                        Imp impCloud on your behalf. When you first run Squinter 2.0, it will ask you for these credentials and give you
                        the option to store them securely in your keychain to automate login in future. The ‘Account’ menu provides a means
                        to log into your account later if you choose not to do so at the start, or to subsequently sign out.</p>

                        <p>Squinter’s Preferences panel includes a setting to log in when Squinter starts up. Other options include compiling
                        the code linked to all of a Project’s Device Groups when a Project is opened, and automatically retrieving the latest
                        device and Product information at log-in.</p>
                        <p>In addition, Preferences contains settings for the colour of Squinter’s log pane, which mono-spaced font is used, and
                        how file paths should be displayed.</p>

                        <p>Squinter would not be possible without open source software contributions from a number of developers. They are listed
                        in the ‘Acknowledgements’ section of the ‘Help’ menu, along with links to the source code Squinter uses.</p>
