              </ul>
              <p id="ki">&nbsp;</p>
              <h3>Known Issues</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Crashes occurring when Squinter starts are typically the result of changes made to the app's preferences during
                development. The first action to take is to delete the file <code>~/Library/Preferences/com.bps.Squinter.plist</code>. You
                may also need to remove the folder <code>~/Library/Caches/com.bps.Squinter</code>.</li>
                <li>Squinter 2.0 will open and convert project files from older versions of Squinter to an updated file format
                that is not compatible with older versions of Squinter. Make sure you do a 'Save As...' to keep a copy of the
                updated project file. Take care not to overwrite the original if you wish to preserve it. Switching or overwriting
                project files will <b>not</b> affect your source code.</li>
                <li>Squinter 2.0 works with impCentral API entities not Build API / Electric Imp IDE entities, so you may wish
                to keep your copy of Squinter 1.0 for work with older projects until you migrate them to impCentral.</li>
                <li>The impCentral API will not allow you to create products with the same names as existing models, so for manual
                model migration, you will need to delete the model <b>before</b> you create the product, which you can do opening
                the old project file in Squinter 2.0. Squinter will report an API error if you attempt to create a product (or
                open an old project file, which automatically creates a product) without deleting the model first.</li>
                <li>Streamed log items occasionally not displayed (but are present in historical log)</li>
                <li>Offline changes made to projects and/or device groups cannot yet be sync'd with the impCloud. Avoid working with
                Squinter 2.0 offline.</li>
                <li>Collaboration functionality has not yet been included.</li>
                <li>Online help is available but not yet complete</li>
                <li>Squinter 1.0 will not see Squinter 2.0 as an available update. At this time, you must install Squinter 2.0 manually.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Electric Imp Accounts</h2>
              <p>Squinter requires an Electric Imp account. Sign up is free at
              <a href="https://impcentral.electricimp.com">impcentral.electricimp.com</a>. Production functionality requires an
              Enterprise account, for which you must be an Electric Imp customer. Log in using the <b>Account</b> menu:</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid"  src="../images/gfx/account.png" width="612" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /><br>&nbsp;</p>
              <h2>Working With Projects and Products</h2>
              <p>Squinter works with 'projects', each of which is stored as a project file on disk. Each Project links to an
              impCentral 'product' and references the 'device groups' <i>(see below)</i> that that product contains. For each device
              group in the product, the project records which local files contain the source code that will be deployed to that device
              group. Project files are identified by the <code>.squirrelproj</code> file extension. Squinter lets you
              create new projects, either from scratch or by downloading products that already exist in the impCloud.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/new.png" width="612" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>Projects are listed in the <b>Open Projects</b> submenu in the <b>Projects</b> menu, which also presents actions you can
              perform on the currently selected project. You can also select a project from the <b>Current Project</b> popup in
              Squinter's main window.</p>
              <p>New projects are saved by default to Squinter's working directory, which you can set in the app's <b>Preferences</b>
              panel. However, you can also navigate to an alternative location when you save the project. To create
              a new Project, click on appropriate toolbar button or select the relevant option from the <b>Files</b> menu ( <kbd>Cmd-N</kbd> ).
              This menu also
              lists recently opened projects &mdash; as does Squinter's dock icon. You can also save your current project to a new
              file if you wish.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/projects.png" width="680" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>You can create projects when you are not signed in to your Electric Imp account &mdash; perhaps because you're
              out of WiFi range &mdash; and you can upload these at a later time, when you have logged in.</p>
              <p>The <b>Projects</b> menu also presents a list of products associated with your Electric Imp account.
              Each project maintains a one-to-one mapping with a uniquely named product. New projects are uploaded to the
              impCloud as products, and existing products can be downloaded as projects, complete with any device groups
              they contain and the code deployed to those device groups.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/products.png" width="684" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>Squinter also allows you to perform tasks on a selected product, including linking it to an existing project,
              or deleting it from the impCloud. Only products that contain device groups with no assigned devices (or no device
              groups at all) can be deleted.</p>
              <p>When you change a project or one of its device groups, Squinter will indicate to you that the project file needs
              to be saved. It does so using the green circle next to the <b>Current Project</b> popup in the main Squinter window:
              an empty circle tells you the currently selected project has changed and may need to be saved. If you don't wish to
              save the changes, you can choose to ignore them when you quit Squinter or close the project.<br>&nbsp;</p>
              <h2>Working With Device Groups</h2>
              <p>Squinter lists all of the device groups that belong to a given project. When you select a Project,
              its device groups, if any, are listed in the <b>Project's Device Groups</b> submenu in the <b>Device Groups</b>
              menu. Initially the first device group, listed alphabetically, is selected when you open or select a project.
              Only the device groups that belong to the currently selected project are listed, so to view a device
              group from another project, just select or open that project.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/models.png" width="662" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>If any devices have been assigned to a device group, they are listed as submenus to each device group
              listed in the <b>Project's Device Groups</b> submenu.</p>
              <p>When you select a project or one of its device groups, the <b>Device Groups</b> menu enables a number of actions which
              can be performed on the selected device group. This includes editing its name and/or description, getting information
              about the code deployed to it, and even deleting the device group from your project and the impCloud.
              However, you can't delete a device group that has devices assigned to it. You can restart simultaneously
              all of the devices assigned to the selected device group here too.</p>
              <p>Do not delete device groups if you are working offline as they will not be removed from the impCloud. There is
              currently no way to delete a device group locally and have it removed from the impCloud when you connect later.</p>
              <p>Because the code you work on will be uploaded to a given device group rather than to a project
              (as was the case with Squinter 1.0), you will find the commands that allow you to access a device group's
              source code files (and any libraries or other Squirrel files they import) from submenus included
              in the <b>Device Groups</b> menu.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/assign.png" width="612" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>You can add a new device group to a project either by selecting the option from the <b>Project's Device Groups</b>
              submenu, or by choosing <b>Add source files to Project</b> from the <b>Files</b> menu. This can be used to add agent and/or
              device code files to an existing device group, or to add them to a new nevice group created there and
              then.<br>&nbsp;</p>
              <h2>Working With Devices</h2>
              <p>Squinter keeps track of your development devices. It lists these in the <b>Device Groups</b> menu's <b>Project's
              Device Groups</b> submenu, alongside the device group each device is assigned to. Unassigned devices are listed
              in their own submenu under the <b>Device</b> menu. Specific devices can also be selected from the <b>Current Device</b>
              popup menu in Squinter's main window.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/devices.png" width="520" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>In each of these lists, each device's status &mdash; online or offline; logging or not &mdash; is listed
              alongside their names: <img src="../images/gfx/online.png" width="16"/> for online and
              <img src="../images/gfx/logging.png" width="16" /> for logging.</p>
              <p>The <b>Device</b> menu presents actions you can perform on the currently selected device, including getting information
              about it, renaming it, removing it from your account, and removing its association with a device group (unassign
              it).</p>
              <p>You can also force the device to restart. If you want to force all of the devices assigned to a given device group to
              restart, not just the selected one, there's an option for that in the <b>Device Groups</b> menu.</p>
              <p>To update the information Squinter holds about all of of your development devices, select the <b>Update Devices'
              Status</b> command in the <b>Devices</b> menu. This can be selected at any time, and there is an option in Squinter's
              <b>Preferences</b> panel to have this information retrieved automatically whenever the app starts up. You can also
              choose to have this information automatically updated periodically.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/dlist.png" width="400" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>The <b>Devices</b> menu also maintains a submenu of unassigned devices &mdash; those which have not yet been assigned to a
              device group or have been removed from one. When you add a new development device to your account, it will first appear
              in this list, though you may need to update the menu (use the <b>Update Devices' Status</b> command) to see it. Selecting a
              device from this list will affect the <b>Devices</b> menu but not the currently selected device group.</p>
              <p>In addition, Squinter’s <b>Inspector</b> panel can be called up (<kbd>Cmd-Alt-I</kbd>) to provide persistent device,
              and project information:</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/inspector.png" width="690" /></p>
              <p>This panel will update as you select devices and/or load or select different projects.<br>&nbsp;</p>
              <h2>Incorporating Libraries Into Your Code</h2>
              <p>Squinter lets you incorporate multiple files into the source code that is deployed to a given device group.
              Electric Imp applications comprise two files: one for device code, the other for cloud-based agent code. Squinter lets
              you embed into them links to other files, such as local libraries.</p>
              <p>For example, you might want to use the same library in multiple device groups &mdash; they all use the same sensor,
              say &mdash; even between device groups that belong to different projects. Sharing a single library file allows you to
              update that file without having to edit every listing of device or agent code that uses it. You just recompile
              each device group's source code to incorporate the changes you've made to the single library file.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/libs.png" width="654" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>Squinter expects your primary source code files &mdash; a device group's base device and agent code &mdash; to be
              named in the standard Electric Imp schema: <code>*.agent.nut</code> and <code>*.device.nut</code> for, respectively,
              your agent and device code. The two identifiers (represented here by the wildcard *) need not be identical.</p>
              <p>Local library files should be entered into your agent and device source code using the following syntax:<p>
              <pre><code>#import "library_filepath\library_filename"
  #include "library_filepath\library_filename"</code></pre>
              <p>This is to distinguish these libraries from Electric Imp online libraries, which use the <code>#require</code>
              directive.</p>
              <p>The name of the library file is arbitrary, but <code>*.class.nut</code> and <code>*.library.nut</code> are the
              recommended forms. You may include a full Unix filepath; if you only provide a filename, Squinter expects the file to
              reside in the same directory as the <code>*.squirrelproj</code> project file <i>(see 'Working with Projects and
              Products', above)</i>. You can specify files that need to be reached by moving up through
              your folder hierarchy by including <code>..</code> to mean 'go up one level'. For example:</p>
              <pre><code>#import "../../../generic/bootmessage.nut"</code></pre>
              <p>This means go up three folders then down to the folder <i>generic</i> and thus to the file
              <i>bootmessage.nut</i>.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/files.png" width="624" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>Internally, Squinter stores all file locations as paths relative to the project file, though you can choose how file
              paths are displayed by changing the app's Preferences. When Squinter compiles code, it re-checks the links it has
              against those included in the <code>#include</code> statement, updating its internal record as required. Squinter will
              warn you if you move a file while is running.</p>
              <p>Squinter lets you store both library files and blocks of Squirrel or other data in <code>*.nut</code> and
              <code>*.txt</code> files. At compilation, all of these sources are inserted into a master copy of the source code, and
              it is this 'compiled' Squirrel which will be uploaded to the selected device group.<br>&nbsp;</p>
              <h2>Deploying Code</h2>
              <p>Squinter 2.0 allows you to upload compiled code direct to the selected device group: select the <b>Upload</b> option in the
              <b>Device Groups</b> menu. Alternatively, holding down the Option key makes this option <b>Upload with Extra Information</b>; when
              selected, it pops up a panel into which you can enter an optional commit message, an optional source URL and an optional set
              of one or more tags for the deployment. Click on the <b>Upload</b> button to include any extra information you add to the upload, or
              click <b>Skip Extras</b> to upload just the code.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/extra.png" width="612" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>Both of these options are available as separate toolbar items:</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/upload2.png" width="32" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/uploadplus.png" width="32" /><br>
              <small><i>The <b>Upload</b> and <b>Upload Extra</b> toolbar buttons</i></small><br>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The <b>Upload Extra Information</b> item is not part of the standard Squinter toolbar layout, so you will need to click
              on <b>Customize Toolbar...</b> in the 'View' menu to add it. You may also wish to
              add the <b>Show Commits</b> button:</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/commits2.png" width="32" /><br>
              <small><i>The <b>Show Commits</b> toolbar button</i></small><br>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>This will call up a list of all the commits/deployments made to the currently selected device group:</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/commits.png" width="552" /></p>
              <p>Having uploaded code, you can restart the currently selected device by selecting <b>Restart</b> from the <b>Device</b> menu,
              or restart all of the devices assigned to the current device group by selecting <b>Restart</b> from the <b>Device Groups</b>
              menu.<br>&nbsp;</p>
              <h2>Debugging Code</h2>
              <p>You can retrieve the most recent log entries for the selected device in one go (up to a maximum of 200),
              or you can stream logs from the device: entries will appear in Squinter's main window in real time. You can currently
              only stream from up to five devices at a time. This is a limitation of the impCentral API.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/log.png" width="700" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>When you upload code &mdash; using the <b>Upload</b> button or the </b>Device Groups</b> menu option &mdash; the Electric Imp
              impCloud will perform a syntax check. Any errors it spots will be reported in Squinter's log window. Line numbers refer
              to the compiled code, so you can use two actions in the <b>View Compile Source</b> submenu under <b>Device Groups</b> to list the
              current compiled code to help you track down the errors. These two options &mdash; one for device code, the other for
              agent code &mdash; will list the compiled source for the currently selected device group.</p>
              <p id="configuring">If the log window becomes too crowded, you can clear it using the <b>Clear</b> button in the toolbar,
              which is also home to a number of shortcuts to various functions provided by Squinter's menus. You can also print the
              current contents of the log window if you have a printer.<br>&nbsp;</p>
              <h2>Configuring Squinter</h2>
              <p>To take full advantage of Squinter's features, you will need an Electric Imp account. With Squinter 2.0 you <b>no
              longer require a Build API key</b>. Instead you must sign into your account using your Electric Imp username and password
              before Squinter can access the impCloud on your behalf. When you first run Squinter 2.0, it will ask you for these
              credentials and give you the option to store them securely in your keychain to automate login in future. The <b>Account</b>
              menu provides a means to log into your account later if you choose not to do so at the start, or to subsequently sign
              out.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/prefs.png" width="612" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>Squinter's <b>Preferences</b> panel includes a setting to log in when Squinter starts up. Other options include compiling
              the code linked to all of a project's device groups when a project is opened, and automatically retrieving the latest
              device and product information at log-in.</p>
              <p>In addition, <b>Preferences</b> contains settings for the colour of Squinter's log pane, which mono-spaced font is used, and
              how file paths should be displayed. You can also choose how many recently opened project files Squinter will remember for
              you, and how many historical log entries, device history events and past commits will be retrieved when you ask for any of
              these items.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/prefs2.png" width="612" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>Squinter's toolbar is customisable: select the appropriate option from the <b>View</b> menu to make changes to the initial,
              standard layout. You can also choose to hide the toolbar. Squinter supports full-screen mode: click on the green traffic
              light at the top left of the window.</p>
              <p align="center"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/gfx/toolbar.png" width="710" style="border: 1px solid #DDDDDD" /></p>
              <p>Squinter would not be possible without open source software contributions from a number of developers. They are
              listed in the <b>Acknowledgements</b> section of the <b>Help</b> menu, along with links to the source code Squinter
              uses.<br>&nbsp;</p>
              <h2>Updating Squinter</h2>
              <p>You can check for Squinter updates by using the appropriate command in the <b>Squinter</b> menu. You can also tell
              Squinter to check for updates on your behalf: just check the relevant box in the <b>Preferences</b> panel.</p>
